# COVID-19 Prediction Model and Visualizations

#### -- Project Status: [Active]

## Project Intro/Objective
The purpose of this project is to provide data visualizations and machine learning to predict the possiblity of someone having covid-19 based on based off of their symptoms and underlying conditions 

### Methods Used
* Machine Learning
* Data Visualization

### Technologies 
* Python
* Azureml(Classifiers and Regressors)
* D3
* Tableau
* JavaScript
* Pandas, jupyter
* HTML, Bootstrap, CSS
* Flask 
* AWS, Zappa

## Project Description
Coronavirus (COVID-19) is a new disease, and our understanding of the virus that causes it continues to evolve

It was first detected in China and has now been detected in over 100 countries, including the United States

The virus has been named coronavirus (COVID-19)

Our data source is from [covidclinicaldata](https://covidclinicaldata.org/)

## Needs of this project

- frontend developers
- data exploration
- data processing/cleaning
- statistical modeling
- writeup/reporting

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repo (for help see this [tutorial](https://help.github.com/articles/cloning-a-repository/)).
2. Raw Data is being kept [here](Repo folder containing raw data) within this repo.

    *If using offline data mention that and how they may obtain the data from the froup)*
    
3. Data processing/transformation scripts are being kept [here](Repo folder containing data processing scripts/notebooks)
4. etc...

*If your project is well underway and setup is fairly complicated (ie. requires installation of many packages) create another "setup.md" file and link to it here*  

5. Follow setup [instructions](Link to file)

Coronavirus (COVID-19) is a new disease, and our understanding of the virus that causes it continues to evolve

It was first detected in China and has now been detected in over 100 countries, including the United States.Â 

The virus has been named coronavirus (COVID-19)

Our goal for the project was to predict the possiblity of someone having Covid based on existing data.

Libraries and Platforms we used for this project:

Machine Learning Analysis: Azureml(Classifiers and Regressors), Pandas, Jupyter Notebooks, Python

Web: Html, Bootstrap, CSS

Visualization: JavaScript, Tableau

Server: Python , Flask , AWS, Zappa
