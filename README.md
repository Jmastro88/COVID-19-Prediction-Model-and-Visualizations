# COVID-19 Prediction Model and Visualizations

#### -- Project Status: [Active]

## Project Intro/Objective
The purpose of this project is to provide data visualizations and machine learning to predict the possiblity of someone having covid-19 based off of their symptoms and underlying conditions 

### Methods Used
* Machine Learning
* Data Visualization

### Libraries and Platforms
* Python
* Azureml(Classifiers and Regressors)
* D3
* Tableau
* JavaScript
* Pandas, jupyter
* HTML, Bootstrap, CSS
* Flask 
* AWS, Zappa

## Project Description
Coronavirus (COVID-19) is a new disease, and our understanding of the virus that causes it continues to evolve

It was first detected in China and has now been detected in over 100 countries, including the United States

The virus has been named coronavirus (COVID-19)

Our data source is from [covidclinicaldata](https://covidclinicaldata.org/)

Total 1900 data of patients with 85 columns of patients' symptoms and pre-conditions

### Project Steps
* Data Engineering & Preprocessing
* Building Machine Learning Model
* Visualization and Web Development

### Data Engineering & Preprocessing
* dropping unnecessary features 
* filling out missing values
* using Feature Selection method to select top 5 features:
  - loss_of_smell
  - Temperature
  - Sats
  - loss_of_taste
  - diabetes
* Splitting our data into training set and testing set

### Machine Learning Model
* Decision Forests Model

## Needs of this project
- frontend developers
- data exploration
- data processing/cleaning
- statistical modeling
- writeup/reporting
